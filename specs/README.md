# Specifications

This directory contains all workings of the application.

## How to Add Specs

Each spec file should describe a distinct "topic of concern" following the Ralph Wiggum methodology.

**Topic Scope Test**: Can you describe the topic in one sentence without "and"?

- ✅ "The color extraction system analyzes images to identify dominant colors"
- ❌ "The user system handles authentication, profiles, and billing" → Split into 3 specs

## Spec File Format

Create specs with descriptive names like:
- `user-authentication.md`
- `color-extraction.md`
- `api-endpoints.md`

Each spec should include:
- Clear description of the feature/topic
- User stories or requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical constraints
- Edge cases to consider
